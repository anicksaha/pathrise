* Problem: Task Scheduler
* 
* We have scheduler performs tasks. Task types are identified with an integer id. 
* Each task takes 1 interval to complete and once itâ€™s complete we take a cooldown of X intervals before another task of the same type can be run.
* We can still run other tasks with different ids. The cooldown is the same for all task types.
* 
* @Return: An integer representing the minimum intervals needed to process all tasks.
